# Level 2 Task 13 -Algorithms: Hashing

## Task 1

● Create a Java file called linearProbing.java. Inside, write the algorithm for removing entries using linear probing.

## Task 2

● Create a diagram that shows the hash table of size 9 after entries with the keys 55, 22, 19, 1, 111, 39, 72, and 3 are inserted, using separate chaining.

## Task 3

Follow these steps:

● Create a Java file called colours.java. Inside, write a Java random-assignment program that allows the user to enter a list of names and a list of colours (the lists must be equal lengths).

● The program should assign each person a random colour.

● Print out the pairs (i.e. name + colour)
